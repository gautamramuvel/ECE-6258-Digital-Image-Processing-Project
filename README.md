Bone Texture Characterization.
(http://www.univ-orleans.fr/i3mto/challenge-ieee-isbi-bone-texture-characterization)
The evaluation of osteoporotic disease from bone radiograph images presents a major challenge for pattern recognition and medical applications. The goal is to identify osteoporotic cases from healthy controls on 2D bone radiograph images, using texture analysis.
